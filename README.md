User needs are implemented through user stories with acceptance criteria.  User stories can succinctly describe the experience that needs to be programmed.  

The approach to developing a program all depends on factors that deal with complexity, including: team size, number of features, interoperability with other platforms, and the list goes on.  However, most companies are adopting the agile method either as a whole or taking parts of it to create a hybrid framework that can integrate small teams into a large team. I hope to use more Scrum.

A good team member is honest and prompt with communication.  Feedback is crucial to agile, therefore team members must provide adequate feedback on the work being done as well as the customer/user.
